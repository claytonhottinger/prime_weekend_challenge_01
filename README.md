<p>The first weekend assignment!</p>

<p>Let's recap the entire week! This challenge will use <em>all of the things</em> that you have learned this week, and perhaps a little more. You will be building a system that manages employee information.</p>

<p>Make a form that can capture and store employee information:</p>

<ul>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Employee Number</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Last Review Score</li>
<li>Salary </li>
</ul>

<p>Store that information in an object.</p>

<p>Then, with that information captured, construct a list of the most current employee information. Meaning that there should be a full list of employees represented on the screen.</p>

<p>In addition to the employee information add a 'remove' button next to each employee's information. Clicking the 'remove' button will remove that specific employee from the DOM.</p>

<p>In the review score section, implment some sort of color indicator based on their review. The employee reviews should only be able to be 1 - 5. 5 would indicate a good score, 1 would be poor. The way you display this is up to you. </p>

<p>Some potential methods of implementing the color indicator are:</p>

<ul>
<li>highlighting the entire <code>li</code> or <code>div</code> that the employee information is in</li>
<li>or adding a different colored number for each score as it is displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system need not persist when the page refresh. Meaning that a page refresh will reload the entire screen. </p>

<p>Your solution should be as visually appealing as possible, and there will be some consideration of styling when you submission is reviewed. Just using the base styles isn't enough.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-hard-mode-optional" class="anchor" href="#hard-mode-optional" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hard Mode (Optional)</h2>

<p>Include a button to generate a completely random employee. As one more step of hard mode, alphabetically sort the employees in the generated list.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-pro-mode-more-optional" class="anchor" href="#pro-mode-more-optional" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pro Mode (More Optional)</h2>

<p>Include a section at the top of the page that totals the salaries of all the employees (Hint: the trick will be what happens when you remove an employee).</p>
